 pygame.surfarray.pixels2d()
    Reference pixels into a 2d array
    pixels2d(Surface) -> array

    Create a new 2D array that directly references the pixel values in a Surface. Any changes to the array will affect the pixels in the Surface. This is a fast operation since no data is copied.

    Pixels from a 24-bit Surface cannot be referenced, but all other Surface bit depths can.

    The Surface this references will remain locked for the lifetime of the array, since the array generated by this function shares memory with the surface. See the pygame.Surface.lock()lock the Surface memory for pixel access - lock the Surface memory for pixel access method.
